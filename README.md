# Getting Started
Requirements

Xcode (latest recommended)

iOS SDK supporting SwiftUI & WidgetKit

Swift 5.x

# Widget Notes
Implemented using WidgetKit + SwiftUI

Demonstrates TimelineProvider and timeline entries

Widget follows WidgetKit constraints (medium and large family implementation)

# Usage / UX
Browse the recreated UI screens to view shows and their details.

The widget shows a compact snapshot of a show (or placeholder data) to demonstrate timeline rendering.

# Future Goals
🌐 Pull shows and their info from the web (API integration)

➕ Add feature to add shows to watchlist

✅ Add features to add episodes watched

🧭 Add “Movies”, “Discover” and “Profile” tabs

These goals are prioritized to move the app from a static UI recreation to a full-featured, data-driven experience.
